Ok so a bit about me, I love learning new things so tech
was a good fit, specially programming as I have the chance to create things, give life to ideas!
And just like the web, I have a passion for progression and I am always moving foward not only professionally.

I love sports(mostly Olympic Sports) and games, drawing and so I try to play around with these other things when I have a chance.

Recently I've been moving towards mentoring people who are interesting into getting into web development. Considering this overwhelming amount of things to learn, having guidance makes all the difference and by helping other people I feel awesome! üòÅ
