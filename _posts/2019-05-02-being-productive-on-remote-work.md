Have you ever wondered how some people manage to work from home and still be a task killer? So here I am going to talk about this great deed of the braves! Please do not leave the page I can explain. Keeping your productivity alive and kicking requires strong habits and skills. If you do not pursue these things, don't worry because those you can build in yourself and I will tell you how.

### Building strong habits

Start small, because every small thing eventually becomes a big thing as long as you keep feeding it.
Plan your day the night before. As simple as creating a task list for the day and giving it a priority order.
This habit, with time, becomes as natural as eating or drinking water. Some people like to use apps such as [Todoist](https://todoist.com/?lang=en) or paper; paper works better for me but I suggest trying both and seeing what works for you.

### Keep your distractions away

Keeping the phone with the screen turned down with no vibration or sounds combined with
browser extensions that help you focus like [strict workflow](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?brand=CHBD&gl=CA&gclid=CjwKCAjwza_mBRBTEiwASDWVvp9aX_4Omm2LlGhbdQWaovrCWNODsnPAom0FhQQ-In6TaefVcPwIwRoCMvYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) does wonders to help you get into the zone. Being "in the zone" means to get yourself into a mental state where you are almost meditating on the task you're doing at the moment. You do not pay attention to anything else but what is in front of you. It can take a few minutes to get into this state when you're trying to focus and once you do it, you do not want to live without it anymore.

### Keep yourself hydrated

Simply because of the fact that your brain works better this way and you will also feel much less anxious or stressed if you're in a situation of stress. For example, leading you to take better decisions. I know all these things I have mentioned can sound too simple and you might think it is stupid and everyone says it. Right, now stop for a moment and think how many people actually do these simple things?
Or maybe these things can sound basic but to put it in practice in your routine and keep going with them week after week is not a simple task at all. It requires you to go out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

### Keep your body moving

Exercise wether you like it or not, helps your body function better and that includes your brain. Also, keeping you away from laziness, helps you stay relaxed and motivated.

Yet another topic you certainly heard before but makes all the difference sticking to it, those weird sleep patterns where a person does not sleep the same amount of hours every day, do not sleep at least the 7~8h destroys your productivity, do you want to be a zombie coder or Usain Bolt? ⚡️

### Avoid stress at all costs

When you're stressed, your body produces Cortisol which is a hormone you do not want in abundance in your body trust me. This devil can quickly destroy your day! How do you avoid stress at all costs? Primarily high-intensity exercise (such as running, biking, heavy lifting) and the other two members of the Trinity, which are sleep and proper food(including water), you heard that more than a thousand times before right?
I am sure of it because I did too. But in the last 4 years or so I put all these things in practice and it changed my life completely because things do work and the rewards are more than fantastic.

### Practicing self-awareness

Be aware of what is happening to you. Some people do not know what is happening to them and that prevents them from helping themselves. If that is your case start by practicing self-review but please do not judge yourself to the bones. Be kind to yourself and know that everyone commits mistakes. A person without self-awareness will most of the time
run on auto-pilot, which is awful. I mean why are we playing the game of life if it is on autopilot? You have to be aware of what is happening to enjoy the game.

### Conclusion

If, by the end of this content you are thinking "It is too much I give up", think twice because you need all these things either working from an office or at home.
I recommended some "tools" that you can use to improve yourself, but as with any other piece of information you find on the internet, maybe only a piece or two was useful for you in this article. If that is the case I am already happy.
Track your cycles because you will fail, but keep going and taking notes. Or you could have your weekly planner and every Sunday review the week and see what did and did not work. Then plan the next week with the actions you consider necessary to improve certain points.

I hope to have helped you with something through this article, Cheers!
